# Chronicles – Preserving African Oral Histories on the Internet Computer

**Chronicles** is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) to preserve, protect, and empower ownership of African oral histories and indigenous knowledge.

In many African communities, traditions—language, herbal knowledge, folklore, and cultural practices—are passed down orally. These legacies are at risk of disappearing due to migration, westernization, and generational gaps. Chronicles offers a blockchain-powered solution to preserve these narratives and ensure ownership remains with the communities and individuals who share them.

## Concept Summary

Chronicles allows users—elders, storytellers, cultural custodians, or anyone with knowledge—to record their oral histories and mint them directly on-chain as unique digital assets, similar to NFTs.

### Goals

1. **Cultural Preservation** – Protect endangered traditions by making them accessible and permanent on-chain.
2. **Ownership & Monetization** – Enable knowledge holders to retain ownership and optionally share, archive, or monetize their content in a censorship-resistant environment.

## Key Features

- **Record & Mint Oral Histories** – Users can record stories, document traditional skills or cultural practices, and mint them as blockchain assets.
- **Marketplace Integration** – Users can list their minted histories for sale or keep them private. The marketplace facilitates both cultural exchange and income generation.
- **Full On-Chain Storage** – Chronicles runs entirely on the Internet Computer: application logic, user data, and digital assets all live on-chain.
- **Decentralized Identity** – Authentication is managed via Internet Identity, providing secure and passwordless login while preserving privacy.
- **Focused on African Heritage** – Chronicles is tailored to preserve African languages, traditions, and ancestral knowledge.

## Why Blockchain? Why ICP?

Traditional platforms often exploit user-generated content, offering little to no control to the creators. Blockchain reverses this model:

- **True Ownership** – Users retain full rights and control over their content.
- **Transparency** – Every minted history is verifiable and traceable on-chain.
- **Immutability** – Once stored, the data cannot be changed or removed.
- **Censorship Resistance** – ICP enables scalable, globally accessible applications without third-party hosting.

**Why Internet Computer (ICP)?**

- Low-cost, scalable storage for multimedia files.
- Supports full-stack dApps (frontend + backend) on-chain.
- Built-in Internet Identity for secure, decentralized authentication.
- No reliance on centralized cloud providers or third-party APIs.

## Who Is Chronicles For?

- Community elders documenting language, culture, and oral traditions.
- Historians and researchers preserving endangered knowledge.
- African youth reconnecting with heritage.
- Cultural entrepreneurs monetizing unique content responsibly.
- Diaspora communities contributing to and accessing cultural knowledge.

## Our Vision

Chronicles is more than a technical solution—it is a cultural preservation movement. We envision a future where:

- African oral histories are permanently accessible on-chain.
- Indigenous communities own and control their stories.
- The global tech ecosystem values and helps preserve intangible cultural heritage.

## Current Progress

- Backend built with Motoko using ICP's BTreeMap architecture.
- Frontend developed with React and TypeScript.
- Internet Identity integrated for decentralized authentication.
- MVP in development for the WCHL 2025 Hackathon.

## Next Steps

- Add support for audio, video, and text-based histories.
- Develop marketplace for trading minted stories.
- Improve accessibility and usability for non-technical users.
- Partner with African communities and cultural organizations.
- Launch on ICP mainnet post-hackathon.
